# Finnish Lesson

Uses a weighted random number generator to make a number between 1 and 999, then works out the formal Finnish name for it. 

Running `$ python finninsh_number_name_maker.py` in the CL will test your Finnish number naming skills right there in the terminal, otherwise running 
`$ python main.py` will make a browser-based version. 


## To-Do:
* Make the test check "spoken" Finnish as opposed to formal Finnish 
* Make it more tolerant of not using the correct accents, maybe?
* Allow the user to specify if the test should be units, tens or hundreds
